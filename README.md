# Django

The folder structure - Are you comfortable with it now? I see many folders here - Kanchan 05/25

So far I'm not confuse with the logic in Django but there are many commands and stuff to remember. There is some weird behaviour with mysql and djanjo. I'm tring to solve that. Almost finish the the assignment from last season, should be able to catch up soon


Cool! I see User registration and bootstrap implementened here! Also add the categories and views for CRUD operations on Category and product along with images being uploaded and displayed back from these views - KAnchan 05/26
